Hello, I'm Franco Kurte, a self-taught software developer passionate about efficient and impactful systems. My interests bridge system programming, performant web development, and biomedical engineering (B.S.), driven by a desire to understand and create across disciplines. My focus is on building robust, high-performance solutions through practical execution and a commitment to efficiency. I value hands-on development, thorough testing, and delivering tangible value with technology.

## Focus Areas

I specialize in system programming and high-performance applications, particularly in low-level networking with Rust and C.  Currently, I'm developing `rusty-tcp`, a ground-up TCP implementation in Rust for direct network control. My expertise extends to web development, creating full-stack applications with React, Spring Boot (Java), and Django (Python). I also work with databases like PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB to build solid data layers. As a Linux enthusiast, I leverage Arch Linux btw, Hyprland and Neovim :)

## Featured Project: rusty-tcp

`rusty-tcp` is my current key project: a low-level, abstraction-free TCP implementation in Rust, designed for deep network control and exploration of TCP/IP fundamentals.

## Philosophy: Efficiency-Driven

My core philosophy is efficiency in action. I believe in creating solutions that are not only functional but also performant and resource-conscious.
