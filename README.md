Hello, I'm Franco Kurte, a self-taught software developer passionate about efficient and impactful systems. My interests bridge system programming, performant web development, and biomedical engineering (B.S.), driven by a desire to understand and create across disciplines. My focus is on building robust, high-performance solutions through practical execution and a commitment to efficiency. I value hands-on development, thorough testing, and delivering tangible value with technology.

## Focus Areas

I like system programming and higher level applications.  Currently, I'm developing `rusty-tcp`, a ground-up TCP implementation in Rust for direct network control. My stack covers: web development, creating full-stack applications with React, Spring Boot (Java), and Django (Python). I also work with RDMS like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and other ones like Redis, and MongoDB to build solid data layers. As a Linux enthusiast, I leverage Arch Linux btw, Hyprland and Neovim.

## Featured Project: rusty-tcp

`rusty-tcp` is my current key project: a low-level, abstraction-free TCP implementation in Rust, designed for deep network control and exploration of TCP/IP fundamentals.

## Technologies

*   **Web Full Stack:** React, Spring Boot (Java), Django (Python)
*   **Systems Programming:** Rust, C, Assembly (NASM, x86_64)
*   **Networking:** Low-level TCP/IP and Packet Analysis (Wireshark)
*   **Database & Backend:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB
*   **Linux Environment:** Arch Linux, Hyprland, Neovim

## Philosophy: Efficiency-Driven

My core philosophy is efficiency in action. I believe in creating solutions that are not only functional but also performant and resource-conscious.
